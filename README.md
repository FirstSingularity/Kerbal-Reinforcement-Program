# Kerbal-Reinforcement-Program
A Deep Q Learning implementation for landing rockets in Kerbal Space Program 1

This project aims to use the Deep Q Learning algorithm to train an AI agent to automomously land rockets in KSP.  It uses pytorch for the neural network and the kRPC mod to control the rocket from the python script.
